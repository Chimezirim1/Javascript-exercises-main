// Arithmetic operators
let sum = 10 + 5;

// Comparison operators
let isEqual = 10 === 10; // Strict equality

// Logical operators
let isTrue = true && false; // AND (both must be true)
let isFalse = true || false; // OR (at least one must be true)
let isNegated = !true; // NOT (inverts the value)

// Increment/decrement operators
let count = 1;

count--; // Decrement (count becomes 1 again)

// Assignment operator
let x = 5;
x += 3; // Equivalent to x = x + 3 (x becomes 8)


//ASSIGNMENTS

// Write expressions using arithmetic operators to calculate the area of a rectangle and the volume of a cube.
// Compare two numbers using different comparison operators and print the results.
// Combine logical operators to create conditional statements that check if a number is even or odd. //use control flow instead
// Experiment with increment and decrement operators to modify variable values.
